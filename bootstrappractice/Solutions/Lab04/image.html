            <p>The T. A. Moulton Barn is a historic barn within the
               Mormon Row Historic District in Teton County, Wyoming, United States.</p>
            <p>The barn is all that remains of the homestead built by Thomas Alma
               Moulton and his sons between about 1912 and 1945. It sits west of
               the road known as Mormon Row, in an area called Antelope Flats,
               between the towns of Kelly and Moose. Now lying within Grand Teton
               National Park, it is near the homestead of Andy Chambers. The property
               with the barn was one of the last parcels sold to the National Park
               Service by the Moulton family. Often photographed, the barn with the
               Teton Range in the background has become a symbol of Jackson Hole.</p>
